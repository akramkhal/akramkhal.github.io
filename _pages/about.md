I am an Assistant Professor of Accounting at BI Norwegian Business School.

My research interests lie in earnings attributes, political economy of accounting and corporate finance. I received my Ph.D. in Business and Finance from [Universidad Carlos III de Madrid](https://business.uc3m.es/en/index) (Spain)

I am deeply interested in empirical research, utilizing cutting-edge data science techniques.
